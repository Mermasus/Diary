# About my diary
# I started learning how to code right before New Year
# I decided that I wanted to keep my first project simple
# Ever since I was a kid I've loved keeping a diary
# And with the way people vent online I thought it was time to make a digital one
# This project is a CLI app to share thoughts that should be kept private
